# Using Sudo

In this challenge we are supposed to read the flag file with sudo access.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{01Voj1jJ-OSYC1XRO8h0qb3YNjA.QX4UDN1wCM0gjNzEzW}`

in this challenge we have to read the `not-the-flag` file as root using `sudo` to get the flag, or else it will show an error permission denied.
