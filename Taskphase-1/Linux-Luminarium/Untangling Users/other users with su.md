# Other Users with Su

Previously we learned how to switch to root using the `su` command, but u can switch to some other user using `su` command also.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{ITWPl9zFRsEoc3LMDqBzkFQP6QV.QX2UDN1wCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this level, we must switch to `zardus` user and then run `/challenge/run`. Zardus' password is `dont-hack-me`.
