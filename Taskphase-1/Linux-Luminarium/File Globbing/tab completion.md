# Tab Completion

We know that `*` is a useful shortcut to shorten some of our typing but it could lead to many unitended errors and harm us more that it helps by selecting the wrong file to remove/delete. Instead what we could use is tab completion which autmatically autocompleted the command we are typing by just a tab press.

## My Solve

Flag - `pwn.college{AbQJj7hfi3B4HzDyCHKc27EQZR4.0FN0EzNxwCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this challenge we had to `cat` the `/challenge/pwncollege` without typing the whole file name instead just using `tab` to autocomplete the name to get the flag.
