# Multiple options for Tab Completion

Previously when we used tab to complete the file we were typing we assumed there was only one such file but in this case we have multiple files starting from the letter p so if we press tab 2 times it will list all those files and we can chose which one we need to get the flag.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{8wsUe7dqBeNqGh9oOr7-oiXy-x_.0lN0EzNxwCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this challenge we have to look for the file starting with letter `p` by using tab completion which will list multiple options and then choose the file containing the flag and `cat` it out to get the flag.
