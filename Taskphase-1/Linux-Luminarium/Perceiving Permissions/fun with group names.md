# Fun with Group Names

Previously we saw that every user is a member of their own group, like hacker is member of hacker group and so on, but this is not always the case, here we need to figure the group we are in out using the `id` command then change group perms of a file.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{4BO9fN18EmvhHcOh9RYVGYY_ofZ.QXycjM1wCM0gjNzEzW}`

Here we need to find our group name and then change group ownership of file `/flag` to our group and then cat it to get the flag.
