# Backgrounding Processes

Earlier we learnt how to send a process to the foreground to resume it, here we learn how to send it to the background to run other commands while it is still running in the backgroun using the `bg` command.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{0oGqYsXfBTPSKjrAAXqFoZcSAsQ.QX3QDO0wCM0gjNzEzW}`

Here we use the terminal to launch it, then suspend it, then background it with `bg` and launch another copy while the first is running in the background.
