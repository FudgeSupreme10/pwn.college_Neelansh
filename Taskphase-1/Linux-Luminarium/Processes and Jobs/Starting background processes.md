# Starting background processes

You don't have to suspend processes to background them: you can start them backgrounded right off the bat! It's easy; all you have to do is append a `&` to the command.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{wQ-Y8COnoHG8j3rOq57o2ydMgeI.QX5QDO0wCM0gjNzEzW}`

Here we need to launch `/challenge/run` backgrounded to get the flag.
