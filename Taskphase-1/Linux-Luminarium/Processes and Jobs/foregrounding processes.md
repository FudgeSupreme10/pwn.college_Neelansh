# Foregrounding Processes

Earlier we learnt how to foreground a process, but what if u want to modify a backgrounded process, then we just run the `fg` command again to foreground it again.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{Md4zvf4Mbm8cPb5W_I9Ji0QFkCI.QX4QDO0wCM0gjNzEzW}`

Here we first run `/challenge/run` then suspend it, and then send it to the background using `bg` then again foreground it to get the flag, as shown below.
