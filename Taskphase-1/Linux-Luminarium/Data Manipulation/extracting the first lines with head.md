# Extracting the first lines with head

In this module we learn how to extract the first 10 lines using `head` command.

## My solve

Flag : `pwn.college{AwctmUlk4sUh0nNk8I3ychMXJou.0lNxEzNxwCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this challenge `/challenge/pwn` outputs a bunch of data, and you'll need to pipe it through head to grab just the first 7 lines and then pipe them onwards to `/challenge/college`.
