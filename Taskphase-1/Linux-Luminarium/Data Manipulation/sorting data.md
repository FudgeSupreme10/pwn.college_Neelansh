# Sorting Data

In this module we learn how to sort data from files or input in a specific order using `sort` command, by default it sorts in alphabetical order, to change that we could use `-r` for reverse order or `-n` for numeric sort.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{kPogpQGstXHGukGM_yeZWtaBmiv.0FM0MDOxwCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this challenge i have to `sort` the `/challenge/flags.txt` file in alphabetical order and the flag would be at the last.
