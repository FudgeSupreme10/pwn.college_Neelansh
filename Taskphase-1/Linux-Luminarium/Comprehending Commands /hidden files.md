# Hidden Files

In this challenge we learn how to view the hidden files, when we use `ls` command to list out all the files in a directory it doesn't list the hidden files that start with a `.` at the start, to also list them we have to add `-a` to the `ls` command as an arguement like this `ls -a`.
