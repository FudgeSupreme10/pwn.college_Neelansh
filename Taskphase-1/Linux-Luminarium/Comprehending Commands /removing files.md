# Removing Files

In this Challenge we learn how to delete files using the `rm` command the syntax to use this command is `rm <filename>`.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{wL23X45D36MGkM7lGVLRpiX5aX3.QX2kDM1wCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this we have to delete the `delete_me` file in our home directory and then run `/challenge/check` which will check if we have deleted the file and then give us the flag (As Shown in the image below).
