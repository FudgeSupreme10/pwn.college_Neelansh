# Touching Files

Now in this challenge we learn how to create a file. There are many ways to do so one of them is using the `touch` command

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{Ua9xivfG_1TT2l8xpomI9zOsHlM.QXwMDO0wCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this Challenge we create 2 files using the `touch` command `/tmp/pwn` and `/tmp/college` files. After that we have to run `/challenge/run` to get the flag (As Shown in the Picture below).
