# Grepping Errors

Now in this module we learn how to redirect the standard error to standard output using to `2>&1` to allow it to grep through piping and get the flag.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{MJzQQqIdzbMICWjMCtgGE8m7rkx.QX1ATO0wCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this challenge we have to convert stout to standard error and then using grep find the flag.
