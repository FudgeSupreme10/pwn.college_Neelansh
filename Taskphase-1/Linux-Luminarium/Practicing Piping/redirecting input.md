# Redirecting Input

In the previous challenges we learned how to redirect output and errors, here we learn how to redirect input, to do this we will be using `<`.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{IaAEFZgcaLC7vLW7jtwborRRSEv.QXwcTN0wCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this challenge we are tasked to first `echo` the word `COLLEGE` to `PWN` file and then redirect the `PWN` file as an input to `/challenge/run`
