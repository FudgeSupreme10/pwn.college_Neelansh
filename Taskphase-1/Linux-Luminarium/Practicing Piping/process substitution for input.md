# Process Substitution for Input

Sometimes when u need to compare the output of 2 commands rather than 2 files process substitution comes very handy then as it temporarily stores the output of the commands into a file for u to use.

## My solve

Flag : `pwn.college{47FQ2EuX3xpmILl9ee8o54BXRG2.0lNwMDOxwCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this challenge i am tasked with finding the real flag from the multiple decoy flags outputted by the 2 commands using process substitution and the `diff` command i need to get the flag as shown in the image below.
