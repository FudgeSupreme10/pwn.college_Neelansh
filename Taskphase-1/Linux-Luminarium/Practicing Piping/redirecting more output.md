# Redirecting More Output

As we learned in the previous module how to direct output of the `echo` command to a file, this doesn't just apply to `echo` command but all the commands.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{wFMBl6s_rwv99ZBxA2esbvQg2jV.QX1YTN0wCM0gjNzEzW}`

So in this challenge our task is to get the output of the `/challenge/run` command and store it in `myflag` file to get the flag.
