# Detaching and attaching (tmux)

`tmux` (terminal multiplexer) is screen's younger, more modern cousin. It does all the same things but with some different key bindings. The biggest difference? Instead of Ctrl-A, tmux uses Ctrl-B as its command prefix.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{cUIvMLuGFC7bRPGJv8HPTTofnH1.0VO4IDOxwCM0gjNzEzW}`

we need to launch tmux and detach from it and run /challenge/run and then reattach to it to get the flag.
