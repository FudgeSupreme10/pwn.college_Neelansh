# Reading Files

In this module we learn how to read files and store them directly into a variable using the `read` command.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{kw8VlLFt0V_zWofRDGL3PfVxjfb.QXwIDO0wCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this challenge we have to read the `/challenge/read_me` file into the `PWN` variable, in a single command to get the flag, the method to achieve this is shown in the image below.
