# storing command output

In this challenge we learn that we can also store command outputs directly inside a variable.

## My Solve

Flag : `pwn.college{U7UfJQUBrWpPs5JPrDCxSiOA8_J.QX1cDN1wCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this challenge we need to store the command output of `/challenge/pwn` into `PWN` variable directly to get the flag.
