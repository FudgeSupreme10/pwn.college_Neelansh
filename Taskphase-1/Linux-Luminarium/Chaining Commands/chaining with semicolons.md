# Chaining with semicolons

Here we learn how to execute 2 independent commands in a single line by chaining them using a `;`.

## My solve

Flag : `pwn.college{UhhL4hMxzT-bLXHfizdtGTyRBnb.QX1UDO0wCM0gjNzEzW}`

In this level, you must run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, chaining them with a semicolon.

```bash
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn;/challenge/college 
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UhhL4hMxzT-bLXHfizdtGTyRBnb.QX1UDO0wCM0gjNzEzW}
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ 
```
